# This is necessary because we download the toolchain using
# http_archive, which bazel places in _execroot_/external/_repo_name_.

# Unfortunately we cannot provide this location as the argument of tool_path
# when configuring the toolchain, because tool_path only takes a relative path.

# This is the fairly common workaround to handle this.
