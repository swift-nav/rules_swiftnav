def construct_local_include(path):
    """Helper to correctly set up local (non-public) include paths.

    When a bazel workspace is consumed externally, (i.e. via local_repository),
    its sources are placed under <execroot>/external/<workspace_root>/. This
    typically breaks local include paths defined using -I.

    This macro ensures that the include path is constructed correctly both when
    building a workpace standalone, and externally.

    Args:
        path: The include path relative to the package this macro is called from

            Use the special argument $(GENDIR) to construct an include path for
            any generated files the build depends on. Assumes these files are
            not generated into a subdirectory.
    """
    root = Label(native.repository_name() + "//:WORKSPACE").workspace_root or "."
    package = native.package_name()

    # Generated files are placed in $(GENDIR)/external/<workspace_root>
    if path == "$(GENDIR)":
